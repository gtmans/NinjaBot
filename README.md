This code and 3D model is an adaption of robotlk code and 3D-parts and combines robotlk code Remote_XY (control by phone/app) and selfmove avoid code.
You can use left and right arm button to turn selfmove avoid on or off.
I made a breakout board for the D1 using Dual Base v2 for LOLIN(WEMOS)

There are some port changes (made possible by the breakoutboard) and an added Led (optional) to show if (battery)power is on or off. The led blinks depending on distance measurements
<BR><BR> 
PwrLed            on Gpio 12 (D6)
ServoRightFootPin on Gpio 4  (D2) // you can use original port Gpio 2 (D4) but that interferes with buildin led and uploading code
ServoRightLegPin  on Gpio 5  (D1) // you can use original port
 
Because of these changes some of the 3D-parts were modified. You can download them at Github/gtmans/NinjaBot/3D.
You can use the original parts by making some ajustments (with saw and drill and take some parts away)
Also changed parts to make bigger servo-arms fit and added wheelcovers. Changed wheels for "tires" made of plastic drainage tube diameter 6mm.
